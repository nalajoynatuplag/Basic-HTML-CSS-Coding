    I had the pleasure of collaborating with Kris on managing Spa Tech Institute's social media presence. This encompassed creating eye-catching designs and writing engaging content for their posts.

Spa Tech Institute is a distinguished school offering various programs such as massage, esthetics, polarity, cosmetology, barbering, and nail tech at four different locations in the United States.

It was indeed an honor to learn from their expertise.
